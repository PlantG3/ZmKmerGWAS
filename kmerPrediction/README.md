# Project Guideline

- To guide group members having a better sense about the project layout, here we briefly introduce the specific purposes of the [dir system](https://jyanglab.github.io/2017-01-07-project/). The layout of dirs is based on the idea borrowed from [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/architecture.html).

- The guideline for the collaborative [workflow](https://jyanglab.github.io/2017-01-10-project-using-github/).

- Check out progress and things [to-do](TODO.md) and throw ideas via the wiki page.
